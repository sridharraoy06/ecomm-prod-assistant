I'm mentioning cons first.. 1. The battery is not efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day. If you are a normal user and use it on only a 4g\lte network then you may use it for a whole working day. But if u are heavy user  you have to charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times. It totally depends up to your uses and needs ###. [PROS] But you will get a 68 watts fast charging adapter so don't worry it...
